## Analysis Report

During the Summer of 2023, people in New York turned to Citi Bikes to get to their destination. This analysis looked at ride data for the months of May, June, and July of 2023.
This analysis contains several different visualizations across four main dashboards, and these are described below:

 - Main DASH: This dashboard contains three different visualizations, which look at Citi Bike ride data for all three months.
	- 'Total Citi Bike Rides per Month' : Looks at the number of rides taken each month.
	- 'Rides by Day of the Week': Looks at the number of rides taken each day of the week.
	- 'Monthly Rides by Day of the Week': Further breaks down ride volume by day of the week across each of the three months in review.
 - Main DASH - 2:
	- 'Casual vs Member Rides by Day of the Week': Looks at the total number of rides taken each day of the week, but examines the volumes accross Citi Bike Members versus Casual. non-member users.
	- 'Rides Started Each Hour, Member vs. Casual Riders': Looks at the total number of rides taken at each hour of the day, Members vs. Casual users.
 - Start DASH:
	- 'Map of Start Stations with Ride Count': A Map that plots all the different stations where rides were started, and gives a count of the ride volume for the entire summer. More popular starting stations are plotted with a larger, darker marker.
	- '10 Most Popular Starting Stations': A chart that looks at the ten most popular starting stations for the summer.
	- '10 Least Popular Starting stations': A chart that looks at the ten least popular starting stations.
 - End DASH:
	- 'Map of End Stations with Ride Count': A Map that plots all the different stations where rides were ended, and gives a count of the ride volume for the entire summer. More popular starting ending are plotted with a larger, darker marker.
	- '10 Most Popular Ending Stations': A chart that looks at the ten most popular ending stations for the summer.
	- '10 Least Popular Ending stations': A chart that looks at the ten least popular ending stations.

This analysis uncovered some interesting patterns and trends:
	- Overall, July had the greatest number of rides recorded. This could be due to the fact that summer is peaking in July, and there are more people outside to use the available bikes.
	- Mondays and Saturdays in July saw the highest volume of rides recorded.
	- Member riders were the most active group overall, but they had a staggering spike in activity during the hours of 7-8 am, and again from around 4-7 pm. These could be members who use Citi Bikes as their main mode of transport to commute to and from work.
	- The three most popular starting and ending stations were Grove St PATH, Hoboken Terminal - River St & Hudson Pl, and South Waterfront Walkway - Sinatra Dr & 1st. All of these are located in Jersey City and Hoboken.
